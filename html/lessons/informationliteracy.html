        <p class="lessonsubheader">Background   Information</p>
        <p>Issues   of   information   literacy   are   a   hot   topic   in   recent   years.   Evaluating   the   quality   and   veracity of   facts,   and   detecting   "fake   news"   &mdash;   are   vital   skills   for   today's   youth.   This   module   will   help teach   young   people   how   to   find   and   critically   assess   facts   and   data   they   find   on   social   media sites   in   a   conscientious   manner.</p>
        <p>We   define   information   literacy   as   the   ability   to   cautiously   search   and   evaluate   information online.   While   social   media   sites   serve   as   convenient   platforms   for   us   to   look   for   materials   -- from   completing   a   class   project   to   enhancing   our   everyday   knowledge   --   not   every   source   and medium   is   reliable.   Information   literacy   helps   us   not   only   determine   the   accuracy   of   internet content   and   interpret   and   use   new   information   intelligently,   but   also   helps   us   be   responsible when   creating   and   communicating   ideas.</p>
        <p>Social   media   sites   introduce   additional   complications   when   it   comes   to   evaluating   source credibility.   Evaluating   the   validity   of   news   is   difficult,   but   when   news   is   shared   by   people   we know,   our   judgments   about   source   credibility   can   be   clouded   by   our   perceptions   of   the credibility   of   those   people.   It   can   be   hard   to   stop   incorrect   information   when   it's   being   shared by   people   we   generally   trust,   or   by   many   people   at   once.</p>

        <p class="lessonsubheader">Activity:   Can   you   spot   the   difference   between   fake   news   and   real   facts?</p>
        <p>In   this   activity,   we're   going   to   ask   you   to   identify   which   news   people   shared   are   real   and   which of   them   are   fake.</p>
        <p>There   are   eight   easy   ways   to   identify   fake   news   or   information:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visuals   use   emojis/   crazy   images/   bright   colors/   wild   fonts   meant   to   attract   attention</li>
          <li>Uses   excessive   punctuation   or   ALL   CAPS   for   emphasis</li>
          <li>Does   it   seem   like   it's   trying   to   create   an   emotional   reaction?   Make   you   sad   or   angry?</li>
          <li>Does   it   claim   to   be   telling   a   secret/   something   an   authority   figure   doesn't   want   you   to know?</li>
          <li>There   is   no   source   given</li>
          <li>There   is   no   author   given</li>
          <li>There   are   no   direct   quotes,   date   or   statistics/   data</li>
          <li>There   is   no   link   to   the   source   material</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your   job   is   to   decide   whether   the   things   other   users   shared   are   accurate   and   trustworthy.</p>
        <p>If   you   see   that   another   user   is   sharing   news   or   facts   that   you   think   are   real,   hit   the   "like"   button next   to   their   posts.   If   you   think   that   their   posts   are   weird   or   questionable,   use   the   "reply" function   to   explain   to   them   why   you   think   their   posts   are   skeptical.</p>
        <p>You   might   see   that   other   people   are   also   replying   to   the   same   posts   that   you're   planning   to reply   to.   That's   fine!   Just   state   your   opinion,   and   say   why   you   agree   or   disagree   with   their comments.</p>
        <p>After   you're   done,   scroll   through   the   news   feed   and   make   sure   you're   happy   with   your   choices. When   you   complete   this   activity,   you'll   get   a   chance   to   review   the   posts   you   reacted   to;   that   is posts   that   you   liked   and/or   replied   to.</p>
