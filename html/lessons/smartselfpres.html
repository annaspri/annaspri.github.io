      This   module   will   help   build   smart   self-presentation   and   self-disclosure   skills.   We   define self-disclosure   as   the   information   that   we   share   about   ourselves   to   others.   This   can   be   anything from   extremely   personal   stuff,   to   just   everyday   things   –   anything   that   tells   someone   else something   about   us.   Not   all   self-disclosure   is   bad;   in   fact,   it   helps   us   make   friends   and   build good,   trustworthy   reputations.   Self-presentation   is   kind   of   like   the   sum   of   a   lot   of   different self-disclosures-   it’s   how   we   act   around   other   people,   and   how   they   see   us.   Social   media   sites allow   us   to   craft   our   own   identities,   and   reach   lots   of   other   people   at   once,   so   presenting ourselves   carefully   is   very   important.
      Social   media   sites,   and   other   communication   technologies,   make   these   issues   even   more difficult.   Many   social   media   sites   allow   multiple   audiences   to   view   what   we   post,   making   it   hard to   present   ourselves   differently   to   different   groups   of   people.   Online   technologies   also   make   it hard   to   remove   things   we   put   online,   so   things   can   persist   and   spread.
      It’s   especially   important   to   understand   what   kind   of   audiences   we   have   on   different   social media   sites   we   use.   Many   different   people   use   these   sites   –   friends,   parents,   teachers, strangers,   and   everyone   in   between.   Knowing   what   to   keep   private   and   what   to   share   –   and with   who   –   is   an   important   skill.   It   affects   how   people   see   us,   which   can   mean   impacts   for   our friendships,   families,   and   future   chances.
      Introductory   Questions
      ● What   does   “self-presentation”   mean?   (What   you   do   so   that   other   people   see   you   the
      way   you   want   them   to   see   you)
      ● What   does   “self-disclosure”   mean?   (The   things   you   tell   others   about   yourself-   anything
      from   small   facts   to   big   secrets)
      ● Why   might   we   care   about   self-presentation   and   self-disclosure?

      Audience   and   Audience   Control   Questions
      ● When   you   see   something   exciting,   strange,   or   funny,   do   you   keep   it   to   yourself?   Or   do
      you   want   to   share   it   with   other   people?
      ● Who   sees   the   things   you   post   online?
      ● Who   is   your   audience   for...   [face-to-face   conversations,   phone   calls,   texts,   Facebook,
      Kik,   Instagram,   Email,   Snapchat,   Musical.ly]?
      ● What   do   you   use   to   communicate   with   your   ...   [family,   friends,   teachers,   others]?
      ● Would   it   be   weird   to   talk   to   your   teachers   on   an   app   you   usually   use   to   talk   to   your
      friends?
      ● Why   might   it   be   hard   to   control   who   sees   information   that   we   post   online?

       Activity   Prep   Questions
      ● What   do   you   do   when   you   see   someone   presenting   themselves,   or   disclosing
      something,   that’s   not   so   smart?   How   do   you   react? Activity:   Smart   Self-Presentation
      In   this   activity,   we’re   going   to   look   at   a   social   media   site   and   see   how   others   are   presenting themselves   online,   and   the   things   they’re   disclosing.   On   this   site,   like   on   Facebook,   Twitter,   or Instagram,   everyone   can   see   everyone   else’s   posts   –   whether   they’re   parents,   friends,   or anyone   else.
      Your   job   is   to   decide   whether   the   things   the   other   users   on   the   site   are   disclosing   are   smart   or not.   Are   they   aware   of   their   audience?   Are   they   keeping   things   positive?   Are   they   posting anything   that’s   secret,   or   that   they   might   regret?
      If   you   see   that   another   user   is   doing   a   good   job,   hit   the   “like”   button   next   to   their   post   to   tell them   so.   If   they   could   use   some   improvement,   use   the   “reply”   function   to   explain   to   them   how they   could   improve.    You   don’t   have   to   like   or   comment   on   every   post   -   if   it’s   neutral,   or   neither good   nor   bad,   you   don’t   have   to   do   anything.
      You   might   see   that   other   people   are   replying   to   peoples’   posts   too.   If   you   think   someone   else’s reply   isn’t   smart   self-presentation,   you   can   comment   on   that   too.
      After   you’re   done   scrolling   through   the   news   feed   and   offering   feedback   on   peoples’   posts, make   a   post   of   your   own!   Use   the   “new   post”   button   on   the   top   menu   to   create   a   post.   Think up   something   that   you’d   like   to   share   that   would   be   an   example   of   smart   self-presentation,   and use   a   search   engine   to   find   an   image   to   go   with   it.
      When   you’re   done,   you’ll   get   a   chance   to   review   the   posts   you   reacted   to. Any   questions?
      Optional   Activity:   Make   your   own   smart   post
      If   they   complete   the   News   Feed   activity   early,   participants   can   make   their   own   posts   on   the   site that   use   the   skills   they’ve   learned   to   present   themselves   in   a   positive   light   for   their   chosen audience.

       Post-Activity   Discussion
      Review   the   types   of   posts   you   commented   on.
      ● What   kind   of   things   did   you   click   the   “like”   button   for?
      ● Why   did   you   think   these   were   examples   of   smart   self-presentation?
      ● What   kind   of   posts   did   you   comment   on?
      ● What   kinds   of   comments   did   you   make?   Why   did   you   think   these   users   could   improve
      their   self-presentation?
      ● Discuss   the   posts   you   reacted   to   with   a   group   or   with   another   student.   Do   you   disagree
      with   any   of   the   “likes”   or   comments   that   they   made?   Why?
      Post-Activity   Questions
      What   do   you   think   are   the   consequences   of   poor   self-presentation? What   kind   of   self-disclosures   do   you   make   on   social   media?
      How   do   you   want   others   to   see   you   on   different   social   media   sites?
      Think   about   about   a   post   you   made   in   the   past,   or   something   you’ve   shared   with   someone   else. Do   you   think   you   would’ve   “liked”   that   post?   Or   would   you   reply   to   your   past   self   with   advice on   how   to   make   smarter   disclosures?
      If   you   created   a   post   of   your   own,   what   did   it   say   and   why?
