        <p class="lessonsubheader">What is in a TestDrive module?</p>
        <p>A TestDrive module consists of four parts. First, students will learn key
          terms, ideas, and behaviors related to the topic of the module. Afterwards,
          students get a chance to practice the behaviors in a guided setting. Then,
          students get to explore a simulated social media site where they are able
          to interact with the timeline, create their own posts, and get further
          practice in social media skills. The final activity in the module will be
          a reflection page with questions about whatstudents did on the simulated
          social media site, as well as questions for discussion.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">How does TestDrive keep children's data safe?</p>
        <p>TestDrive does not collect personal information. Students can upload pictures
          and text into the simulated social media site, but all uploaded data is
          permanently deleted once the user finishes a module or leaves the TestDrive 
            website. Click <a href="https://app.socialmediatestdrive.org/privacy">here</a> to read our privacy policy.</p>
