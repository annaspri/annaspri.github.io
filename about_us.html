        <p>Social Media TestDrive empowers youth to become prosocial, productive members of the digitalworld through
          media literacy education and experiential learning in a protected yet realistic simulated social media environment.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">About Social Media TestDrive</p>
        <p>Social Media TestDrive is a platform created by researchers in the Cornell University Social Media Lab, in collaboration
          with Common Sense Education, the Program for Research in Youth Development and Engagement, and New
          York State 4-H educators. The project is generously supported by the Morgan Family Foundation. Like a driving simulator for
          young people learning to drive for the first time, TestDrive is a social media simulation designed to let students learn
          about and practice social media skills. TestDrive looks and feels like a real social media site, butall the other users on
          the site are “bots” that post content created by the research team. As a result, students can practice important social media
          skills in a safe and realistic environment without worrying about the consequences of making mistakes.</p>
        <p>Each TestDrive module is designed to teach a specific social media skill, such as managing privacy settings, smart self-presentation,
          upstanding to cyberbullying, and information literacy. A TestDrive module consists of four parts. First, students will learn key terms,
          ideas, and behaviors related to the topic of the module. Afterwards, students get a chance to practice the behaviors in a guided setting.
          Then, students get to explore a simulated social media site wherethey are able to interact with the timeline, create their own posts,
          and get further practice in social media skills. The final activity in the module is a reflection page with questions about whatstudents
          did on the simulated social media site, as well as additional questions for reflection.</p>
