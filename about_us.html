        <p>Social Media TestDrive empowers youth to become prosocial, productive members of the digitalworld through media literacy education and experiential learning in a protected yet realistic simulated social media environment.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">How does a TestDrive lesson work?</p>
        <p>Each TestDrive module is designed to teach a specific social media skill: privacy settings, smart self-presentation, stopping cyberbullying, and information literacy, to name a few. Each module starts with a classroom lesson delivered by an educator or facilitator, with lesson content adapted from Common Sense Media, Harvard University's Youth and Media Program, and Fordham University's Privacy Educators Program. After each brief lesson, students participate in an interactive activity on the TestDrive platform that allows them to put the lesson into action. A group discussion and reflection activity wraps up each module.</p>

        <p class="lessonsubheader">Who created TestDrive?</p>
        <p>TestDrive is a platform created by researchers in the Cornell University Social Media Lab, in collaboration with Common Sense Education, the Program for Research in Youth Development and Engagement, and New York State 4-H educators.</p>
