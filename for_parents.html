        <p class="lessonsubheader">What is Social Media TestDrive?</p>
        <p>TestDrive is a platform created by researchers in the <a class="fontbig" href="http://sml.comm.cornell.edu target=blank>Cornell University Social Media Lab</a> in collaboration with <a class="fontbig" href="commonsense.org/education/" target=blank>Common Sense Education.</a></p>
        <p>TestDrive is an educational program that offers a number of modules about key digital citizenship topics, such as managing privacy settings, smart self-presentation, upstanding to cyberbullying, and news literacy.</p>
        <p>Each TestDrive module teaches a set of digital citizenship concepts and allows youth to practice and reflect upon what they have learned using a simulated social media experience within a safe and protected platform.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">Can I use TestDrive at home with my child?</p>
        <p>Yes, we encourage parents to try out TestDrive with their children! All
          TestDrive modules can be a self-guided activity, but you can also go through
          modules together with your child. You can access TestDrive modules at the
          following link: <a href="http://app.socialmediatestdrive.org">http://app.socialmediatestdrive.org</a>.
          Please see our “Lessons” page for a short description of each TestDrive module.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">How does a TestDrive module work?</p>
        <p>In a TestDrive module, children will first learn key terms and practice
          social mediaskills in a guided setting. Then, children get to explore a
          simulated social media site where they are able to interact with the
          timeline, create their own posts, and get further practice in social
          media skills. The final activity in the module will be a reflection
          page with questions about what children did on the simulated social
          media site, as well as questions for discussion.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">How can I see my child’s progress?</p>
        <p>At the end of the reflection page, there is a feature (“Print your
          responses”) that enables children to save or print their responses to
          the reflection questions. You can ask your child to print out the responses
           or save them as a PDF file on the computer. You can review the responses
           to see how well your child is understanding the module content.</p>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">What else do I need to know?</p>
        <p>We encourage you to keep the conversation going about responsible social
          media use! Young people can learn a lot from talking with parents about
          social media, so we recommend using TestDrive as a tool to generate
          meaningful discussions about social media use.</p>
