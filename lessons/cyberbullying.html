        <p class="lessonsubheader">Background   Information</p>
        <p>This module   will   help   teach   kids   how   to   detect   signs   of   cyberbullying   and   how   to   react   when they   find   it.   It   builds   on   work   that   suggests   that   being   an   "upstander"   in   situations   of   bullying can   go   a   long   way   toward   getting   bullying   to   stop.<p>
        <p>Cyberbullying   can   be   described   harassing   or   demeaning   behavior   that   occurs   online   or   via information   technology,   and   is   often   repeated.   Unfortunately,   it   is   fairly   common   among   teens. Cyberbullying   can   take   the   form   of   negative   comments   from   a   stranger,   or   posting embarrassing   pictures   of   your   friend.      Things   that   are   meant   to   come   off   in   a   joking   manner   can have   negative   consequences.   Researchers   have   found   that   encouraging   "upstanding"   behavior, rather   than   "bystanding",   can   help   mitigate   cyberbullying.<p>
        <p>Communication   technologies   can   be   a   positive   space   for   teens   to   interact   and   grow,   but   it   can also   be   a   space   filled   with   negativity.      It   is   important   that   this   module   teach   teens   how   to maintain   positive   interactions   and   to   stop   any   possible   negativity   that   may   ensue.</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">Activity:   Be   an   Upstander</p>
        <p>In   this   activity,   we're   going   to   look   at   a   social   media   site   and   see   how   others   interact.   On   this site,   like   Facebook,   Twitter,   or   Instagram,   everyone   can   see   each   other's   posts,   including   your friends,   parents,   coaches   or   teachers,   and   other   people.</p>
        <p>Your   job   is   to   decide   whether   the   posts   people   share   are   appropriate.   Particularly,   are   they hurtful?   Are   they   unnecessarily   rude   or   mean?   Do   they   make   you   worried?   Do   you   see   any personal   attacks?   Flag   any   posts   you   think   are   bad   and   should   be   deleted.</p>
        <p>If   you   see   someone   saying   something   you   think   is   rude   or   mean,   you   can   reply   to   their   post   to tell   them   how   to   improve   their   behavior.   If   you   see   that   someone   has   been   hurt   by   another's actions,   you   can   reply   to   their   posts   to   offer   help   or   support.   You   might   see   that   other   people are   replying   to   people's   posts.   You   can   add   to   those   conversations   too.</p>
        <p>If   you   see   someone   saying   something   that's   kind   or   supportive,   or   someone   who   is   standing   up against   cyberbullying,   you   can   "like"   their   post   to   tell   them   they're   doing   a   good   job.</p>
        <p>After   you're   done   scrolling   through   the   news   feed   and   offering   feedback,   click   "next."   You'll   get a   chance   to   review   the   posts   you   have   reacted   to.</p>
        <p>Any   questions?</p>

        <p class="lessonsubheader">Optional   Activity:   Say   Something   Positive</p>
        <p>If   they   complete   the   News   Feed   activity   early,   participants   can   make   their   own   posts   on   the   site that   use   the   upstanding   skills   they've   learned.</p>

        <p class="lessonsubheader">Post-Activity   Discussion</p>
        <p>Review   the   types   of   posts   you   commented   on.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Why   did   you   respond   the   way   you   did?   What   kinds   of   things   did   you   say?</li>
        <li>What   kinds   of   posts   did   you   flag?   Why   did   you   flag   them?</li>
        <li>Discuss   the   posts   you   flagged   and   replied   to   with   someone   else   in   the   group.   Did   both   of you   flag   the   same   posts?   Do   you   agree   with   his   or   her   replies?   Are   there   any   posts   you wished   you   flagged   or   replied   but   you   did   not?   Why?</li>
        <li>What   kinds   of   posts   did   you   "like"?</li>
        <li>If   you   made   your   own   post,   what   did   your   post   say?   Why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lessonsubheader">Post-Activity   Questions</p>
        <p>What   do   you   think   are   the   consequences   of   cyberbullying?   For   the   victim?   For   the   bully? Think   about   the   websites      you   go   on   or   the   social   media   sites   you   use.   Do   you   ever   see cyberbullying   happen   on   those   sites?   What   will   you   do   to   stop   it?</p>
        <p>How   is   being   an   upstander   different   offline   and   online?   What   are   things   that   we   need   to   think carefully   about   when   trying   to   stop   a   cyberbully?   (anonymity,   retaliation,   etc)</p>
