            <p class="black">This module will teach students how to detect signs of cyberbullying and
              how to respond to cyberbullying situations. Students will be able to practice
              "upstanding" behaviors to cyberbullying such as supporting the target, confronting
              the bully, and reporting the cyberbullying posts to the social media site.</p>

            <p> Evaluating the quality and veracity of facts and detecting fake news are vital skills for today's youth. This lesson will help teach students to find and critically assess facts and data they find on social media sites, and to help others do the same. </p>

            <p> Likes are a common way to show appreciation on social media sites. But sometimes people focus more on getting likes than on actually liking others.  This lesson will help students think critically about what likes are, what it means to "like" something, and how to distinguish between popularity and quality of social media content. </p>

            <p>Social media sites, especially image-heavy ones, have received a lot of criticism for harming users' self-esteem. This lesson will encourage critical thinking about how we compare our real selves to others' carefully curated social media images of themselves. </p>
